        <p>Hey! I'm Luke.</p>
        <p>I'm studying computer science in Georgia State University's undergraduate program and working on consumer-scale automation on the side. I want to be useful in as many areas of the web stack as possible, but I've been doing primarily back-end web work and projects with hobby/IoT controllers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. A number of my recent projects or components of recent projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/lukedsmalley">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Presently I work with Node.js and Java, though I'm converting some personal projects to TypeScript. I've also worked in Python, C#, and (on an admittedly shallow level) C++. Language is less a barrier for me as much as my framework-specific experience, which I have yet to develop. I have done a limited amount of front-end web work with Vue.js/Webpack.</p>
        <p>I love Major League Hacking events. Since sophomore year I've attended HackGT, UGAHacks, HackFSU, and several HackGSUs. This year, I'm looking to attend several more events as a part of a team sponsored by GSU's student organization PantherHackers.</p>
        <p>I managed the Robotics and Programming merit badge at Woodruff Scout Reservation during the summers of 2015-2018. I was also a retail pharmacy associate for a couple years following the summer of 2015. Creating solutions to truly increase efficiency and reduce waste in the healthcare sector would be exciting.</p>
        <p>I'd enjoy talking tech with you! Feel free to direct-message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/lukedsmalley">Twitter (@lukedsmalley)</a> or send me an email at <a href="mailto:lukedsmalley@gmail.com">lukedsmalley@gmail.com</a>. I can also be emailed through GSU at <a href="mailto:lsmalley1@student.gsu.edu">lsmalley1@student.gsu.edu</a>.</p>
        <p>This page is also a redesign prototype for my current personal homepage, <a href="https://smalley.sh">smalley.sh</a>.</p>
